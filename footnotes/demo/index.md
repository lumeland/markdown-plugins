Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they

belong to the previous footnote.

Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have
to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]
